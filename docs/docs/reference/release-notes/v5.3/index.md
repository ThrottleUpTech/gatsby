## ES Modules (ESM) in Gatsby files

## Improved error messages

### Show original stack trace from workers

You might have run into an error like this while using Gatsby:

```shell
ERROR #85928

An error occurred during parallel query running.

Error: Worker exited before finishing task
```

Gatsby uses [worker threads](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/worker_threads.html) to execute its GraphQL queries in parallel (with its own package [`gatsby-worker`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-worker)). When Parallel Query Running was introduced these workers were already instructed to propagate their errors to the main process so that you can see what actually happened. Unfortunately, at a certain workload the workers didn't have enough time to relay those messages and you were left alone with the above mentioned worker error.

In the PR [feat(gatsby-worker): Show original stack trace](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/37206) we have now given `gatsby-worker` the ability to save its errors to a local, temporary file and then the main process can playback any messages that otherwise might have been lost. We have further plans to improve this functionality but the main pain point was fixed with the above PR. You should now successfully see the original error, with any amount of workload.

### Improve readability of errors & warnings

When you saw the error "Building static HTML failed for path ..." or the warning "This query took more than 15s to run..." Gatsby printed the complete contents of the page data to the terminal. The intentation behind that was to give you enough context to fix the error yourself. But since this also included the GraphQL results those logs could get verbose really quickly. In the [PR #37220](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/37220) this was fixed by removing properties from the page data, including the GraphQL results before printing them out. In normal circumstances the errors thrown by GraphQL or Gatsby itself will give you enough details to solve your error.

### Improved error during Gatsby Preview

When you use [Gatsby Preview](/products/cloud/previews/) and your site errors out on rendering the HTML, you'll now see an improved overlay. The [PR #37195](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/37195) improved the CSS styling, made it clearer what the error is and how to fix it, and added clearer structure to the overlay itself.
